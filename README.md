# Data Conversion for Satellite Imagery Analysis

## Introduction
This repository provides Python code for converting satellite data into a format suitable for deep learning models. It supports various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-data-.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages if you haven't already.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Prepare Your Data**: Replace `satellite_data.csv` with your dataset. Ensure that your CSV file contains satellite data with features and the target variable.
4. **Customize the Code**: Open and modify `preprocess_satellite_data.py` according to your data preprocessing requirements.
5. **Run the Script**: Execute the preprocessing script.
   ```bash
   python preprocess_satellite_data.py
   ```
6. **Check Output**: The preprocessed data will be saved as NumPy arrays (`X_train.npy`, `X_test.npy`, `y_train.npy`, `y_test.npy`) in the same directory.

## Preprocessing Steps
add this section

n the data-saving step as per your requirements.
